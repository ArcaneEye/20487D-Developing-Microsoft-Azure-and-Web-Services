# Module 6: Deploying and Managing Services

# Lab: Deploying an ASP.NET Core web service on Linux

1. Wherever you see a path to file starting at [Repository Root], replace it with the absolute path to the directory in which the 20487 repository resides. 
 e.g. - you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487, then the following path: [Repository Root]\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01 will become C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01
2. Wherever you see {YourInitials}, replace it with your actual initials.(for example, the initials for John Do will be jd).

### Exercise 1: Publish the ASP.NET Core web service for Linux

#### Task 1: Use a Docker container to build a self-contained ASP.NET Core web service

1. Open **Command Line**.
2. Run the following command to change directory to **Starter** folder:
    ```bash
    cd [Repository Root]\Allfiles\Mod06\Labfiles\Exercise1\Starter
    ```
3. Run the following command to open the project in **VSCode**: 
    ```bash
    code .
    ```
4. Right click on **Starter** area  inside the **EXPLORER** panel and select **New File** name it **.dockerignore**.
   >**Note: .dockerignore** it is for exclude files and directories from the containers
5. Click on **.dockerignore** file and paste the following code:
    ```sh
    .dockerignore
    .env
    .git
    .gitignore
    .vs
    .vscode
    docker-compose.yml
    docker-compose.*.yml
    */bin
    */obj
    ```
6. Right click on **BlueYonder.Flights.Service** and select **New File** and name it **Dockerfile**.
7. Click on **Dockerfile** file and paste the following code to get image named **dotnet:2.1-sdk**:
    ```dh
    FROM microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk AS build-env
    WORKDIR /app
    ```
8. Paste the following code to copy and restore the project:
    ```sh
    # Copy csproj and restore as distinct layers
    COPY *.csproj ./
    RUN dotnet restore
    ```
9. Paste the following code to build the project
    ```sh
    # Copy everything else and build
    COPY . ./
    RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out
    ```
10. Paste the following code to get image named **dotnet:2.1-aspnetcore-runtime** and build it:
    ```sh
    # Build runtime image
    FROM microsoft/dotnet:2.1-aspnetcore-runtime
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY --from=build-env /app/out .
    ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "BlueYonder.Flights.Service.dll"]
    ```

#### Task 2: Use a Linux Docker container to host the web service

1. Switch to **Command Line**.
2. Run the following command to change directory to **BlueYonder.Flights.Service** project: 
    ```bash
    cd BlueYonder.Flights.Service
    ```
3. Run the following command to build the contener and name it **blueYonder**:
    ```bash
    docker build -t blueYonder .
    ```
4. Run the following command to run the contener on port **1234**:
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 1234:80 --name webapp blueYonder
    ```
5. Open **Microsoft Edge** browser.
6. Navigate to the following url:
    ```url
    http://localhost:1234/api/destinations
    ```
7. The **GET** response should return a json with all the **Destinations**.

### Exercise 2: Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy

#### Task 1: Use Nginx in a container to reverse-proxy the ASP.NET web service

1. Switch to **VSCode**.
2. Right click on **Starter** area  inside the **EXPLORER** panel and select **New Folder** name it **nginx**.
3. Right click on **nginx** folder, select **New File** and name it **nginx.conf**.
4. Paste the following code:
    ```sh
    user  nginx;
    worker_processes  1;

    error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;
    pid        /var/run/nginx.pid;

    events {
        worker_connections  1024;
    }

    http {
      server {
        listen 80 default_server;

        location /test {
          proxy_pass http://host.docker.internal:1234;
          rewrite ^/test(.*)$ $1 break;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    check **proxy_pass** this is the path of the revers proxy 
    and the **test** is what need to be added for using **proxy_pass**
5. Right click on **nginx** folder, select **New File** and name it **dockerfile**.
6. Paste the following code to copy **nginx** image and change **conf** file:
    ```sh   
    FROM nginx
   
    COPY ./nginx.conf /etc/nginx/

    CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
    ```
7. Switch to **Command Line**.
8. Run the following command to change directory to **nginx** folder:
    ```bash
    cd nginx
    ```
9. Rum the following command to build the contener and name it **nginxproxy**
    ```bash
    docker build -t nginxproxy .
    ```
10. Run the following command to run **nginx** on port **1235**:
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 1235:80 --name ngninx nginxproxy
    ```
11. Switch to **Microsoft Edge** browser.
12. Navigate to the following url:
    ```url
    http://localhost:1235/test/api/destinations
    ```
13. The **GET** response should return a json with all the **Destinations** just like the in **Exercise 1**.
14. Switch to **Command Line**.

15. Run the following command to stop **webapp** process:
    ```bash
    docker stop webapp
    ```
16. Run the following command to stop **ngninx** process:
    ```bash
    docker stop ngninx
    ```

#### Task 2: Create a Docker Compose file for bringing up both containers

1. Switch to **VSCode**.
2. Right click on **nginx** folder, select **New File** and name it **docker-compose.yml**.
3. Paste the following code to compose all the services that need to be running:
    ```sh
    version: '3'
    services:
      nginx:
        image: nginxproxy
        ports:
         - "1235:80"
      webapp:
        image: "myapp"
    ```
4. Click on **nginx.conf** in **nginx** folder.
5. Locate **proxy_pass**  change the **url** to the following url:
    ```url
    http://webapp:80
    ```
6. Switch to **Command Line**.
7. Run the following command to build the contener after the change
    ```bash
    docker build -t nginxproxy .
    ```
8. Run the following code to run the **docker-compose**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
9. Switch to **Microsoft Edge** browser.
10. Navigate to the following url:
    ```url
    http://localhost:1235/test/api/destinations
    ```
11. The **GET** response should return a json with all the **Destinations** just like the in **Exercise 1**.
12. Switch to **Command Line**.
13. Stop all the services in the **docker-compose** press **Ctrl + C**:
