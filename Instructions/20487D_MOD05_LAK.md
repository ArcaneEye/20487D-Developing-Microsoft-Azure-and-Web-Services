#### Task 2: Implement an HTTP trigger that invokes the flights booking Azure Web App

1. In your newly **BookFlightFunc** class, locate the **usings** assemblies, and then press **Enter** after the last **using** which is **Newtonsoft.Json**.
2. Add the following **usings** in the new line after **using Newtonsoft.Json**:
    ```
    using System.Net.Http;
    using System.Text;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    ```
3. Replace all the **Run** method implementation with the following code that makes a request to your **Flights booking Azure Web App** that you have created in **Lab 2**:
    ```cs
    log.Info("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request to the flights booking service.");

    var flightId = req.Query["flightId"];

    var flightServiceUrl = $"http://blueyonder-flights-{Your Initials}.azurewebsites.net/api/flights/bookFlight?flightId={flightId}";

    log.Info($"Flights service url:{flightServiceUrl}");

    var travelers = new List<Traveler>
     {
        new Traveler { Email = "204837Dazure@gmail.com" , FirstName = "Jonathan", LastName = "James", MobilePhone = "+61 0658748", Passport = "204837DCBA" },
        new Traveler { Email = "204837Dfunction@gmail.com", FirstName = "James", LastName = "Barkal", MobilePhone = "+61 0658355", Passport = "204837DCBABC" }
     };

    var travelersAsJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(travelers);

    using (var client = new HttpClient())
    {
        client.PostAsync(flightServiceUrl,
                         new StringContent(travelersAsJson,
                                           Encoding.UTF8,
                                           "application/json")).Wait();
    }

    return (ActionResult)new OkObjectResult($"Request to book flight was sent successfully");
    ```
    >**NOTE:** Replace **{Your Initials}** in the **flightServiceUrl** with your actual initials.


#### Task 3: Test the Function App locally in a browser

1. On the **Visual Studio Build** menu, click **Build Solution**.
2. On the **Debug** menu, click **Start Debugging (F5)**.
3. Open a browser and nevigate to **http://localhost:7071/api/BookFlightFunc?flightId=1**.
4. Check that you are getting a good response like the following:
    ```
    Request to book flight was sent successfully
    ```
5. Check that the travelers were actually booked to flight number 1 by opening a browser and nevigate to the following address:<br/>

   **http://blueyonder-flights-{Your Initials}.azurewebsites.net/api/flights**

    >**NOTE:** Replace **{Your Initials}** with your actual initials.

6. Check that you are getting a good response like the following:
    ```json
    [{"flightId":1,"origin":"New York","destination":"Paris","flightNumber":"204837D","departureTime":"2018-10-10T00:00:00","travelers":[{"travelerId":1,"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"James","mobilePhone":"+61 0658748","passport":"204837DCBA","email":"204837Dazure@gmail.com"},{"travelerId":2,"firstName":"James","lastName":"Barkal","mobilePhone":"+61 0658355","passport":"204837DCBABC","email":"204837Dfunction@gmail.com"}]},{"flightId":2,"origin":"Paris","destination":"Rome","flightNumber":"204837C","departureTime":"2017-10-10T00:00:00","travelers":[]}]
    ```    

### Exercise 2: Deploy the service to Azure Functions

#### Task 1: Deploy the service to Azure Functions from Visual Studio

1. Right-click on your **BlueYonder.Flights.GroupProxy** solution, point to **Add** and then click **Publish**.    
2. On the **Pick a publish target** window, choose **Create New** from the **Azure App Service** options, and then click **Create Profile**.
3. On the **Create App Service** window, in the **Microsoft account** right drop-down list, click **Add an account**.
    >**NOTE:** You will be asked to sign in with your azure credentials. <br/>
               Sign in with your azure user name and password.
4. On the **App Name** box, type **BookFlightFunctionApp-{Your Initials}**.
    >**NOTE:** Replace **{Your Initials}** with your actual initials.
5. On the **Resource Group** drop-down list, choose **BlueYonder.Lab.05 (eastus)**.
6. Click on the **Create** button to create a new **App Service** in azure for your function app.
7. Click on the **Publish** button to deploy your **Function App** to **Azure**.
   >**NOTE** If you will asked to update **Azure application settings** click **Yes**

#### Task 2: Test the Function App on Azure in a browser              

1. Open a browser and nevigate to **https://bookflightfunctionapp-{Your Initials}.azurewebsites.net/api/BookFlightFunc?flightId=1**.
    >**NOTE:** Replace **{Your Initials}** with your actual initials.
2. Check that you are getting a good response like the following:
	 ```cs
    Request to book flight was sent successfully
     ```
3. Check that the travelers were actually booked to flight number 1 by opening a browser and nevigate to the following address:<br/>

   **http://blueyonder-flights-{Your Initials}.azurewebsites.net/api/flights**

    >**NOTE:** Replace **{Your Initials}** with your actual initials.

4. Check that you are getting a good response like the following:
    ```json
    [{"flightId":1,"origin":"New York","destination":"Paris","flightNumber":"204837D","departureTime":"2018-10-10T00:00:00","travelers":[{"travelerId":1,"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"James","mobilePhone":"+61 0658748","passport":"204837DCBA","email":"204837Dazure@gmail.com"},{"travelerId":2,"firstName":"James","lastName":"Barkal","mobilePhone":"+61 0658355","passport":"204837DCBABC","email":"204837Dfunction@gmail.com"},{"travelerId":3,"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"James","mobilePhone":"+61 0658748","passport":"204837DCBA","email":"204837Dazure@gmail.com"},{"travelerId":4,"firstName":"James","lastName":"Barkal","mobilePhone":"+61 0658355","passport":"204837DCBABC","email":"204837Dfunction@gmail.com"}]},{"flightId":2,"origin":"Paris","destination":"Rome","flightNumber":"204837C","departureTime":"2017-10-10T00:00:00","travelers":[]}]
    ```
    >**NOTE:** You are seeing the same travelers that you have added earlier(locally) but with differents **Traveler Id's**.
