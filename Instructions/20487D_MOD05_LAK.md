# Module 5: Hosting Services On-Premises and in Azure



# Lab: Host an ASP.NET Core service in a Windows Service

1. Wherever you see a path to file starting at [Repository Root], replace it with the absolute path to the directory in which the 20487 repository resides. 
 e.g. - you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487, then the following path: [Repository Root]\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01 will become C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01
2. Wherever you see {YourInitials}, replace it with your actual initials.(for example, the initials for John Do will be jd).

### Exercise 1: Create an ASP.NET Core Application

#### Task 1: Create an ASP.NET Core Application Project

8. Go back to **Assets** folder.
9. Drag class named **FlightsController.cs** and drop it in the **Controllers** folder inside the **VSCode**.
10. In **Explorer** blade, under the **BLUEYONDER.FLIGHTS.SERVICE** pane, double-click on **BlueYonder.Flights.Service.csproj** class.
11. Locate the last **\<PropertyGroup>** section.
12. Add **\<RuntimeIdentifier>win7-x64\</RuntimeIdentifier>** below the **TargetFramework** tag.

    ```cs
          <PropertyGroup>
            <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>
            <RuntimeIdentifier>win7-x64</RuntimeIdentifier>
          </PropertyGroup>
    ```
13. Press **Ctrl+S** to save the file.

#### Task 2: Install the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.WindowsServices NuGet package

1. Change directory in the **Command Line** by running the following command and then press **Enter**:
    ```bash
    cd [Repository Root]\Allfiles\Mod05\Labfiles\Exercise1\Starter\BlueYonder.Flights.Service
    ```    
2. Paste the following commands in the **Command Line** in order to install **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.WindowsServices** NuGet package which allows you to run the **ASP.NET Core** project as a **Windows Service** and then press **Enter**:
     ```bash
    dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.WindowsServices --version 2.1.1
    ```
#### Task 3: Modify the Main method to use Kestrel RunAsService hosting

1. Go back to the opened instance of **VSCode**.
    >**NOTE:** If you do not have it open, paste the following command and then press **Enter**:

    ```bash
    code .
    ```
2. In **Explorer** blade, under the **BLUEYONDER.FLIGHTS.SERVICE** pand, double-click on **Program.cs** class.

```cs   
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.WindowsServices;
```    
5. Change the **Main** method implementation to be as the following:
```cs
    CreateWebHostBuilder(args).Build().RunAsService();
```
6. Verify that after these two changes your **Program.cs** class looks like the following:
```cs
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.IO;
    using System.Linq;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore;

                    .Build();
        }
    }

   ```bash
      dotnet publish --configuration Release --output [Repository Root]\Allfiles\Mod05\Labfiles\Exercise1\Starter\BlueYonder.Flights.Service\svc
   ```
4. Paste the following command in order to create your **Windows Service** and then press **Enter**:
   ```bash
      sc create FlightsService binPath= "[Repository Root]\Allfiles\Mod05\Labfiles\Exercise1\Starter\BlueYonder.Flights.Service\svc\BlueYonder.Flights.Service.exe"
   ```



#### Task 2: Start the Windows Service and test it

1. Paste the following command in order to start your **Windows Service** and then press **Enter**:
