# Module 10: Scaling Services

# Lab: Load Balancing Azure Web Apps

1. Wherever you see a path to file starting at [Repository Root], replace it with the absolute path to the directory in which the 20487 repository resides. 
 e.g. - you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487, then the following path: [Repository Root]\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01 will become C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01
2. Wherever you see **{YourInitials}**, replace it with your actual initials.(for example, the initials for John Do will be jd).
3. Before performing the demonstration, you should allow some time for the provisioning of the different Azure resources required for the demonstration. It is recommended to review the demonstrations before the actual class and identify the resources and then prepare them beforehand to save classroom time.


### Exercise 1: Prepare the application for load-balancing

#### Task 1: Add code to print out the server name

1. Open **Command Line**.
2. Change directory to the starter project, run the following command in the **Command Line**:
    ```bash
    cd [Repository Root]\Allfiles\Mod10\Labfiles\Lab1\Starter
    ```
3. Restore all dependencies and tools of a project use the following command in the **Command Line**:
    ```base
    dotnet restore
    ```
4. Open the project in **VSCode** and paste the following command and press enter:
    ```bash
    code .
    ```
5. Right click on **BlueYonder.Flights.Service** and select **New Folder** and name it **Middleware**.
6. Right click on **Middleware** folder and select **New File** and name it **ExceptionHandlingMiddleware** then select the new class.
7. Paste the following **using** to the class.
    ```cs
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Linq;
    using System.Net;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
    using Newtonsoft.Json;
    ```
8. Paste the following code to add namespace.
    ```cs
    namespace BlueYonder.Flights.Service.Middleware
    {

    }
    ```
9. Paste the following code in namespace brackets to class declaration:
    ```cs
    public class MachineNameMiddleware
    {

    }
    ```
10. Paste the following code inside the class brackets to add a constructor:
    ```cs
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public MachineNameMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }
    ```
11. Paste the following code to add **Invoke** method that add **X-BlueYonder-Server** header with the **MachineName** as value:
    ```cs
    public async Task Invoke(HttpContext httpContext)
    {
        httpContext.Response.Headers.Add("X-BlueYonder-Server", Environment.MachineName);
            
        await _next(httpContext);
    }
    ```
12. Paste the following code outside the class brackets but inside namespace brackets to add **extension method** for **IApplicationBuilder**:
    ```cs
    public static class MachineNameMiddlewareExtensions
    {
        public static IApplicationBuilder UseMachineNameMiddleware(this IApplicationBuilder builder)
        {
            return builder.UseMiddleware<MachineNameMiddleware>();
        }
    }
    ```
13. Inside **BlueYonder.Flights.Service** project, locate and click on **Startup** file:
14. Paste the following **using**:
    ```cs
    using BlueYonder.Flights.Service.Middleware;
    ```
15. Locate **Configure** method and paste the following code to use **Exception Handling Middleware**:
    ```cs
    app.UseMachineNameMiddleware();
    ```
16. Switch to **Command Line**.
17. Run the following command to run the server:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

#### Task 2: Deploy the application to an Azure Web App



#### Task 3: Configure the Web App for multiple instances

1. Click on the newly created web app.
2. On the **Settings** blade, scroll down to **Scale out (App Service plan)**.
3. Click on **Scale out (App Service plan)** inside SETTINGS section.
4. To increate the instances, locate the ** ** scale, and increase it to **2**.
5. Click on **Save**.
6. Wait until all changes saved.


### Exercise 2: Test the load balancing with instance affinity

#### Task 1: Browse the website multiple times

1. Open **Microsoft Edge** browser.
2. Navigate to **http://localhost:5000/api/destenations**.
3. Check that you are getting a good response like the following:
	```json
		["value1", "value2"]
	```
