 Wherever you see a path to file starting at [repository root], replace it with the absolute path to the directory in which the 20487 repository resides. 
 e.g. - you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to [Repository Root]\Downloads\20487, then the following path: [repository root]\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01 will become C:\Users\John [Repository Root]\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01
