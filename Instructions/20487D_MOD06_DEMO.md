# Module 2: Querying and Manipulating Data Using Entity Framework

 Wherever you see a path to file starting at [repository root], replace it with the absolute path to the directory in which the 20487 repository resides. 
 e.g. - you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487, then the following path: [repository root]\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01 will become C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01

11. In the action bar, click **Add**, select **Web App**, and then at the bottom of the third screen, click **Create** .
12.	In the **App name** box, type the name **mod6demo1***YourInitials* (YourInitials contains your initials). This is a unique value, which when combined with the **.azurewebsites.net** suffix is used as the URL to your web app.

        You only need to perform this step once, to import your Microsoft Azure account settings to Visual Studio.

    >**Note:** Visual Studio publishes the application according to the settings that are provided in the profile file.

24. In the browser navigate to the following **URL**:
    ```url
    http://mo6demo1[YourInitials].azurewebsites.net/api/values
    ```
25. Verify that the response is: **["value1","value2"]**.
25. Close all open windows.
