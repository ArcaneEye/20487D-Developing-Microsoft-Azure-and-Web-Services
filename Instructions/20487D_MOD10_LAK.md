# Module 10: Scaling Services

# Lab: Load Balancing Azure Web Apps

1. Wherever you see a path to file starting at [Repository Root], replace it with the absolute path to the directory in which the 20487 repository resides.
   e.g. - you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487, then the following path: [Repository Root]\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01 will become C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01
2. Wherever you see **{YourInitials}**, replace it with your actual initials.(for example, the initials for John Do will be jd).
3. Before performing the demonstration, you should allow some time for the provisioning of the different Azure resources required for the demonstration. It is recommended to review the demonstrations before the actual class and identify the resources and then prepare them beforehand to save classroom time.

### Preparation Steps

1. Open **PowerShell** as **Administrator**.
2. In the **User Account Control** modal, click **Yes**.
3. Run the following command: **Install-Module azurerm -AllowClobber -MinimumVersion 5.4.1**.
4. Navigate to **[repository root]\AllFiles\Mod10\Labfiles\Lab1\Starter\Setup**.
5. Run the following command:
    ```batch
     .\createAzureServices.ps1
    ```
6. You will be asked to supply a **Subscription ID**, which you can get by performing the following steps:
    1. Open a browser and navigate to **http://portal.azure.com**. If a page appears, asking for your email address, type your email address, and then click Continue. Wait for the sign-in page to appear, enter your email address and password, and then click Sign In.
    2. In the search text box on the top bar, type **Cost** and then in results click **Cost Management + Billing(Preview)**. The **Cost Management + Billing** window should open.
    3. Under **BILLING ACCOUNT**, click **Subscriptions**.
