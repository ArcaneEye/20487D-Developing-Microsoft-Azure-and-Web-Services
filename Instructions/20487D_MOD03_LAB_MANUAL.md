# Module 3: Creating and Consuming ASP.NET Core Web APIs 

# Lab: Creating an ASP.NET Core Web API 

#### Scenario

In this lab, you will create and use ASP.NET Core Web APIs.

#### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Create a Web API controller to expose APIs.
- Invoke the API through a browser.
- Use **httpClient**, create **ConsoleApplication**, and then connect to the server by using **httpClient**.


### Exercise 1: Create a Controller Class
 
#### Task 1: Add a controller class

1. Open Command Prompt, and then browse to **Repository Root]\Allfiles\Mod03\LabFiles\Lab1\Starter**.
2. Open the project in Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
3. In the **BlueYonder.Hotels.Service** project, add a new controller called **HotelBookingController**.
4. In **HotelBookingController**, add the **HotelBookingRepository** field, and then initialize the field by using the constructor.

#### Task 2: Add action methods to the controller for GET, POST, and PUT

1. Add a new **GET** action with the *id* parameter, and then return the **Booking** entity.
2. Add a new **POST** action with the *Booking* parameter, and then return the **Booking** entity.
3. Add a new **PUT** action with the *id* and *Booking* parameters, and then return the **Booking** entity.

### Exercise 2: Use the API from a Browser

#### Task 1: Use a browser to access the GET action

1. Run the **BlueYonder.Hotels.Service** service.
2. Open a browser, and then browse to the **GET** action with **id 1**.
   
   >**Result:** You should see the **Booking** reservation with **Booking Id: 1**.

### Exercise 3: Create a Client

#### Task 1: Create a console project and add the reference to System.Net.Http

1. Create a new console application called **BlueYonder.Hotels.Client**.
2. Add the **BlueYonder.Hotels.Client** project to the solution.
3. In the **BlueYonder.Hotels.Client** project, install the **Microsoft AspNet WebApi Client** package.

#### Task 2: Use HttpClient to Call the GET and PUT Actions of the Controller

1. Open the **BlueYonder.Hotels.Client** project in Visual Studio Code.
2. In **BlueYonder.Hotels.Client.csproj**, add a reference DAL class library.
3. In **Program.cs**, change the **Main** method return type declaration to **async Task**.
4. In the **Main** method, create a new **HttpClient** instance.
5. Inside the **HttpClient** bracket, create a **HotelBooking GET** request, and pass **id=1** to it.
6. To read the content of the response as a string, under **HttpResponseMessage**, use **ReadAsStringAsync**, and print the result to the console.
7. Read the content of the response as a **Booking** entity.
8. CHange the **Paid** property of the response to **false**.
9. Create a **PUT** request, and then pass the **id=1** to it, and the response a **Booking** entity.
10. Read the content of the **PUT** response as a string, and print the result to the console.
11. Run the **BlueYonder.Hotels.Service** project.
12. Run the **BlueYonder.Hotels.Client** project.
13. At the command prompt, verify that the bookings from the **GET** and the **PUT** requests appear. 

# Lab: Self-Hosting an ASP.NET Core Web API  

#### Scenario

In this exercise, you will self-host an ASP.NET Core Web API with HttpSys and Kestrel.

#### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Use **HttpSys** and **Kestrel** to host the Web API project.
- Use command line arguments to invoke the hosting environment.

### Exercise 1: Use HttpSys

#### Task 1: Add a new HttpSys option to the list of commands

1. Open a **Command Prompt** window, and then browse to **Repository Root]\Allfiles\Mod03\LabFiles\Lab2\Starter**.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
3. To get arguments from the command prompt, in the **BlueYonder.Hotels.Service** folder, locate **Program.cs**, and then paste the following code inside the **Main** method:
    ```cs
     IConfigurationRoot config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
                                        .AddCommandLine(args)
                                        .Build();

    string userServicePreference = config["mode"];
    ```
4. Create **WebHostBuilder**, and then check if the argument has the **HttpSys** mode.
5. Add a default mode by using Internet Information Server (IIS) express.
6. Run the **Builder** with:
   ```cs
    builder.Build().Run();
   ```

#### Task 2: Run the project by using HttpSys and retest with a browser

1. At the command prompt, open **BlueYonder.Hotels.Service**.
2. To run the project with the **HttpSys** mode, run the following command:
   ```bash
    dotnet run --mode=HttpSys
   ```
3. In the browser, on port **5000**, browse to **Hotel api**, and then verify that it has **[Hotel1,Hotel2]**.

### Exercise 2: Use Kestrel

#### Task 1: Add a new Kestrel option to the list of commands

1. Switch to Visual Studio Code.
2. In **BlueYonder.Hotels.Service**, in **Program.cs**, between **if** and **else**, add a new **Kestrel mode** hosting .

#### Task 2: Run the project by using Kestrel and retest with the .NET console client

1. From the command prompt, browse to **Repository Root]\Allfiles\Mod03\LabFiles\Lab2\Starter\BlueYonder.Hotels**.
2. Run the project in the **Kestrel** mode.
3.  From the command prompt, browse to **Repository Root]\Allfiles\Mod03\LabFiles\Lab2\Starter\BlueYonder.Client**, and then run the project.
4. From the command prompt, verify that the **POST** and **PUT** requests succeeded.
