# Module 6: Implementing data storage in Azure

# Lab: Storing Files in Azure Storage 

1. Wherever you see a path to file starting at [Repository Root], replace it with the absolute path to the directory in which the 20487 repository resides. 
 e.g. - you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487, then the following path: [Repository Root]\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01 will become C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01
2. Wherever you see {YourInitials}, replace it with your actual initials.(for example, the initials for John Do will be jd).
