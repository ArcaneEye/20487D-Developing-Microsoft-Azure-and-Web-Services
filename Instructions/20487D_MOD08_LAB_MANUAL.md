# Module 8: Diagnostics and Monitoring

# Lab: Collect and view ETW events 

#### Scenario

In this lab, you will use Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) on Windows and LTTng on Linux to monitor exception and garbage collection (GC) events in a Microsoft ASP.NET Core application.

#### Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:
-	Collect and analyze ETW events with PerfView for an ASP.NET Core application on Windows.
-	Collect and analyze LTTng events for an ASP.NET Core application on a Linux Docker container.

### Exercise 1: Publish the ASP.NET Core web service for Linux
 
#### Task 1: Run the ASP.NET Core application

1. Open the command prompt, and then navigate to **[Repository Root]\AllFiles\Mod08\Labfiles\Lab1\Blueyonder.Service** folder.
2. Run the project.

#### Task 2: Record .NET ETW events in PerfView

   Open **PerfView**, and then collect all the events

#### Task 3: Run a script to invoke the service and meck it to throw exceptions

1. In PowerShell, from the **assets** folder, run the **requestsToServer** script.
2. Switch to **PerfView** and stop collecting the events.

#### Task 4: View exception details and call stacks in PerfView

1. In **Advanced Group**, click **Exceptions Stacks**.
2. Locate the **Blueyonder.Service** process.
3. Locate the exception and view the call stack.

### Exercise 2: Collect and view LTTng events

#### Task 1: Run the ASP.NET Core application in a Linux container with COMPlus_EventLogEnabled=1

1. Open the command prompt, and then navigate to the **[Repository Root]\AllFiles\Mod08\Labfiles\Lab1\Blueyonder.Service** folder.
2. Run the project in docker on port **8080:80** and name **myapp**.

#### Task 2: Record LTTng events with the Lttng CLI tool

1. Enter to **myapp** container the shell.
2. Update the packages in the container.
3. Install the **software-properties-common** package.
4. Add **PPA repository**.
5. Install the **LTTng** package.
6. Create a session in **LTTng**.
7. Run a command to add context data (process id, thread id, process name) to each event.
8. Run a command to create an event rule to record all the events starting with **DotNETRuntime**.
9. Start recording events.
10. Open the browser and navigate to the service a few times.

#### Task 3: View LTTng exception and GC events with the babeltrace CLI tool

1. Stop recording the events, and then destroy the session.
2. To view all the recorded events, run the **babeltrace** command.

#### Task 4: Open the recording file on Windows with PerfView

1. To archive the **trace** folder, run the following command:
   ```bash
   zip -r /root/lttng-traces/sample-trace sample.trace.zip
   ```
2. Copy the archive to the local file system.
3. Remove the **myapp** container.
4. Open the zip file in PerfView and look at the events.

# Lab: Monitor Azure Web Apps with Microsoft Azure Application Insights

#### Scenario

In this lab, you will use Application Insights to monitor and diagnose a web service running in Azure Web Apps.

#### Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:
- Add Application Insights to your application.
- Load test your service by using Azure.
- Analyze performance by using Application Insights.

### Exercise 1: Add the Application Insights SDK

#### Task 1: Add the Application Insights SDK to the web service project

1. Open **Azure Portal**.
2. Setup **Application Insights** for the new **blueyondermod08lab2***{YourInitials}* app service.
 - In the setup config the **Runtime/Framework** to **ASP.NET Core**.
3. From the new **Application Insights**, copy **Instrumentation Key**.
4. Open the command prompt, and then navigate to the **[Repository Root]\Allfiles\Mod08\Labfiles\Lab2\Starter** folder.
5. At the command prompt, install the **Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore** package.
6. To **appsettings.json**, add the following key:
    ```json
    "ApplicationInsights": {
        "InstrumentationKey": "{InstrumentationKey}"
    }
    ```
7. Replace the **InstrumentationKey** key with the value copied in point 3.
8. In the **Program** class, add **ApplicationInsights** to the host builder.

#### Task 2: Publish the service to Azure Web Apps

   At the command prompt, publish the service.

### Exercise 2: Load test the web service

#### Task 1: Create a new performance test in the Azure Portal

1. Switch to **Azure Portal**.
2. Navigate to **Performance test** and configure with the following steps:
    - Create a new **Organization** and name it **blueyondervsts***{YourInitials}*.
    - In the new **blueyondervsts** resource, navigate to **VSTS**.
    - In **VSTS**, create a new project and name it **Blueyonder**.

#### Task 2: Run the performance test for a few minutes with multiple simulated users

1. Switch to **Azure Portal**.
2. Create a new **Performance test** with the following conifgration:
    - In **TEST TYPE**, select **Manual Test**.
    - In **URL**, type **http://blueyondermod08lab2***{YourInitials}***.azurewebsites.net/api/destinations**.
    - In **Name**, type **DestinationsTest**.
    - In **USER LOAD**, type **20**.
    - In **DURATION (MINUTES)**, type **5**.

### Exercise 3: Analyze the performance results

#### Task 1: View the overall website performance and request metrics

1. Switch to **VSTS**.
2. View the summary of **DestinationsTest**.

#### Task 2: Examine specific requests and view their timelines and dependencies

1. Scroll down and locate **OPERATION NAME**.
2. Click **GET destinations/Get**.
3. On the right-hand side, view info about the request.

#### Task 3: Drill down into the Application Insights Profiler results for slow requests

1. In the right-hand bottom corner, click **Samples**.
2. View all the requests and click the request with the highest duration.
3. View all the details about the request.
