8. Add the **ApplicationInsights** to the host builder in the **Program** class.

#### Task 2: Publish the service to Azure Web Apps

1. Publish the service via **Command Line**.

### Exercise 2: Load test the web service

#### Task 1: Create a new performance test in the Azure Portal

1. Switch to **Azure Portal**.
2. Naviage to **Performance test** and configute with the following steps:

    - In the new resources **blueyondervsts** naviage to **VSTS**..
    - Create new project in the **VSTS** and named it **Blueyonder**.

#### Task 2: Run the performance test for a few minutes with multiple simulated users

1. Switch to **Azure Portal**.
2. Create new **Performance test** with the following conifgration:
    - In **TEST TYPE** select **Manual Test**.
    - In **URL** type **http://blueyondermod08lab2{YourInitials}.azurewebsites.net/api/destinations**.
    - In **Name** type **DestinationsTest**.
