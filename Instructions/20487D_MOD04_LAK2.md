1. Open **Command Line**.
2. Change directory to the starter project, run the following command in the **Command Line**:
    ```bash
    cd [Repository Root]\Allfiles\Mod04\DemoFiles\AsynchronousActions\Starter
    ```
3. Restore all dependencies and tools of a project use the following command in the **Command Line**:

        if (file.Length > 0)
        {
            using (var fileStream = new FileStream(Path.Combine(_environment.WebRootPath, file.FileName), FileMode.CreateNew))
            {
                await file.CopyToAsync(fileStream);
