# Module 1: Overview of Service and Cloud Technologies

# Lab: Exploring the Work Environment

Wherever you see a path to file starting at [Repository Root], replace it with the absolute path to the directory in which the 20487 repository resides. 
 e.g. - you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487, then the following path: [Repository Root]\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01 will become C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01

### Exercise 1: Creating an ASP.NET Core project

#### Task 1: Create a new ASP.NET Core project

1. Open **Command Line**.
2. For creating a new **ASP.NET Core Web API** project, At the **Command Line** paste the following command and press enter:
    ```bash
        dotnet new webapi -name BlueYonder.Flights -output [Repository Root]\20487D-Developing-Microsoft-Azure-and-Web-Services\Allfiles\Mod01\Labfiles\Exercise1
    ```  
3. Now that the project was created, change directory in the **Command Line** by running the following command:
    ```bash
        cd [Repository Root]\20487D-Developing-Microsoft-Azure-and-Web-Services\Allfiles\Mod01\Labfiles\Exercise1
    ```
4. To open the project in **Visual Studio Code** paste the following command and press enter: 
    ```bash
        code .
    ```

### Exercise 2: Create a simple Entity Framework model

#### Task 1: Create a new POCO entity

1. The **Exercise1** folder opens in **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**. Select the **Startup.cs** file.
    - Select **Yes** to the Warn message **"Required assets to build and debug are missing from 'Exercise1'. Add them?"**.
    - Select **Restore** to the Info message **"There are unresolved dependencies"**.
2. Add a new folder **Models** by right click on the **Explorer Pane** on the left, and select **New Folder**.
3. Right click on **Models** folder, select **New C# Class**, then type **Flight** in the textbox on the top, and press **Enter**.
4. In the **Flight.cs** Copy the using statement below to the begin of the file:
    ```cs
        using System;
    ```
5. Locate the class **Flight** and paste the following code between the brackets:
    ```cs
        public string Origin { get; set; }
        public string Destination { get; set; }
        public string FlightNumber { get; set; }
        public DateTime DepartureTime { get; set; }
        public TimeSpan Duration { get; set; }
    ```

#### Task 2: Create a new DbContext class

1. Right click on **Models** folder, select **New C# Class**, then type **FilghtsContext** in the textbox on the top, and press **Enter**.
2. Paste the following using statement in the top of the file **FilghtsContext**:
    ```cs
        using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
    ```
3. Inherite the class **FlightContext** from **DbContext**,your code should look like:
    ```cs
        public class FlightsContext : DbContext
    ```
4. Inside the class paste the following code: 
    ```cs
        public FlightsContext(DbContextOptions<FlightsContext> options)
            : base(options)
        {
        }

        public DbSet<FlightsContext> Flights { get; set; }
    ```
5. Go to **Startup.cs** and paste the following using statement:
    ```cs
        using Exercise1.Models;
        using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
    ```
6. In the **ConfigureServices** method paste the following code:
